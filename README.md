Code development for IoT device prototype


This project will serve as a means to develop a prototype remote sensor, for the collection, storage and transmission of environmental data.
Objectives:

-demonstrate the proccess of developing a script to run the necessary functions of a remotely deployed

sensor using commonly available components, such as a Raspberry Pi 3B, various sensor modules (Ph

meter/thermister/humidity/image capture/etc), either from consumer sources or assembled in the lab

using the basic materials needed for economy, and agile project development

-to learn

-to share.
